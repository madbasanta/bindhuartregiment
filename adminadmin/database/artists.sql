In a way, our entire existence is a search for connections, a sense of belonging. We search for it in the relationships we make, in nature, and even within ourselves. This journey and its findings make up our human experience. However, at certain moments and phases in our life, for some reason or no reason at all, it feels like we have lost all our connections to life. This isolation and sense of dissonance amplifies one&rsquo;s solitude, the monotony of days, it warps our perception of time and space within our own loneliness. But what is lost, can be found.

Many of his artworks are related to human emotion, experience, and exploration, sensory and perception - which invites you to be an observer of the self. Interested in experiments, exploring possibilities through paint and installations. Momin usually plays with the use of shades, space, and sounds. He is interested in persistent, complex, and uncomfortable human emotions such as longing, helplessness and vulnerability.

Within the depths of the human spirit lies a profound complexity of emotions and thoughts. Some of these emotions are too intricate, too overwhelming to put it out in the world, and thus we find ourselves retreating, concealing them from the world. We shrink within, isolating ourselves in a realm where our innermost thoughts echo, where the weight of our feelings engulfs us. In that solitude, a palpable silence that speaks volumes, in that there is peace, though heavy. In this, there are feelings hidden within, in pieces and in fragments. Small fragments stowed away amidst others.
