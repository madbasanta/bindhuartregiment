Kechana village is located at eastern Nepal- jhapa border to India 8km away also the lowest altitude of Nepal Kanchan kawal lies here. This village witnessed historical land settlement of 1970 B.S, a movement led by the late King Mahendra of bringing back Nepali families from Burma and India. Families who migrated from Burma and India were extremely religious and practiced Hinduism strictly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The outer layer of the village is largely covered with these families, Gandarvas have somehow found their settlement in the middle. In the times where untouchability was still in practice in Nepal their quest for dignity was never Gandarvas have contributed immensely to our country&rsquo;s musical heritage. In Hinduism, Gandharva are regarded to be the celestial demigods who serve as the musicians of the devas(gods) and bought connections from heaven to earth, not just mythology but the way they existed and contributed to our society clarifies and states their importance in time memorials. Previous generations of Gandharvas kept the Culture alive and made folk tunes, sang stories of people&rsquo;s mundane life, entertained everyone, provided social commentary news, and healed people with their minstrel performances. Undoubtedly Gandharvas served as a poet, historian, and journalist long before the advent of radio in Nepal and expandes the sensibilities of writing music. They created a large spectrum of rhythmic writing and trans melody in music.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They traveled relentless as nomadic performing their music in different landscapes of country through out the year. Today Gandarvas are recognized as dalits in present society.

In 2076 they received X amount of funds for their dream museum project which still was insufficient. After the change in powers inside the organisation they decided to complete the dream museum project with a new campaign(save our culture) traveling from Mechi to Mahakali and performing their music. They state this campaign as a new methodology of preserving their traditional minstrel practice and advocating dignity in contemporary society. Minstrels have few demands from the present government which they aspire to receive from this campaign as they reach the Nation&rsquo;s capital Kathmandu to end the campaigning journey &ldquo;SAVE OUR CULTURE&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The last three months minstrels are on a relentless traveling journey performing at various municipalities, public spaces and advocating dignity, raising funds through music of their pastoral tradition. Currently they are receiving tremendous response from different mayors, province ministers and local stakeholders. Currently mayor of Dharan Harka sampang has taken this campaign initiative into the action of preserving Gandarva culture and helping to raise funds for the museum. Today Gandarvas have learned to organise themselves rather than being nomadic clarifies Kanka Bogoti gandarva( founder of Gandarva uplift society). He recalls how chaotic the conflict was before, it took many years to educate people inside the community to understand the importance of being organised in modern society. Mr.Bogati states &ldquo;The first challenge was to educate people of our community and second to fight for dignity and our rights&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The former president explains &ldquo;museum as new methodology to restore their places in society and cultural history of the Nation. Further explains organisation plans to develop into the center of attraction and emerge themselves as potential citizens to contribute in the development of society. This museum will help us to participate or be active in society &ldquo;. &ldquo;The society which never equals us how we can fight with them being marginalized? Setting up the museum of our glorious historical musical traditions will be an answer.
