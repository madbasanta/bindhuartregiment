        Welcome to Bindhu Art Regiment's "About Us" section. At the heart of this creative journey stand 
        two passionate visionaries: Saugat Upreti and Poojan Gyawali. With unwavering dedication, they 
        embarked on building the prototype of Bindhu Art Regiment years ago. As a harmonious team, they 
        have nurtured the core of art and steered the realization of Bindhu Art Regiment's goals. 
        Their collaborative spirit continues to shape our artistic community, inspiring artists to 
        transcend boundaries and celebrate the boundless power of creativity.
