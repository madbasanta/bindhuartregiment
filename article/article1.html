                jhapa border to India 8km away also the lowest altitude of Nepal Kanchan kawal lies here. This village
                witnessed historical land settlement of 1970 B.S, a movement led by the late King Mahendra of bringing
                back Nepali families from Burma and India. Families who migrated from Burma and India were
                extremely religious and practiced Hinduism strictly.

                <br>
                The outer layer of the village is largely covered with these families, Gandarvas have somehow found
                their settlement in the middle. In the times where untouchability was still in practice in Nepal their
                quest for dignity was never Gandarvas have contributed immensely to our country’s musical heritage. In
                Hinduism, Gandharva are regarded to be the celestial demigods who serve as the musicians of the
                devas(gods) and bought connections from heaven to earth, not just mythology but the way they existed
                and contributed to our society clarifies and states their importance in time memorials. Previous
                generations of Gandharvas kept the Culture alive and made folk tunes, sang stories of people’s

                mundane life, entertained everyone, provided social commentary news, and healed people with their
                minstrel performances. Undoubtedly Gandharvas served as a poet, historian, and journalist long before
                the advent of radio in Nepal and expandes the sensibilities of writing music. They created a large
                spectrum of rhythmic writing and trans melody in music.

                The last 5years Gandarva music museum has been an incubation process. In 2076 they received X
                amount of funds for their dream museum project which still was insufficient. After the change in powers
                inside the organisation they decided to complete the dream museum project with a new campaign(save
                our culture) traveling from Mechi to Mahakali and performing their music. They state this campaign as a
                new methodology of preserving their traditional minstrel practice and advocating dignity in
                contemporary society. Minstrels have few demands from the present government which they aspire to
                receive from this campaign as they reach the Nation’s capital Kathmandu to end the campaigning
                journey “SAVE OUR CULTURE”.
                <br><br>
                The last three months minstrels are on a relentless traveling journey performing at various
                municipalities, public spaces and advocating dignity, raising funds through music of their pastoral
                tradition. Currently they are receiving tremendous response from different mayors, province ministers
                and local stakeholders. Currently mayor of Dharan Harka sampang has taken this campaign initiative

                into the action of preserving Gandarva culture and helping to raise funds for the museum. Today
                Gandarvas have learned to organise themselves rather than being nomadic clarifies Kanka Bogoti
                gandarva( founder of Gandarva uplift society). He recalls how chaotic the conflict was before, it took
                many years to educate people inside the community to understand the importance of being organised
                in modern society. Mr.Bogati states “The first challenge was to educate people of our community and
                second to fight for dignity and our rights”.
                <br><br>
                The former president explains “museum as new methodology to restore their places in society and
                cultural history of the Nation. Further explains organisation plans to develop into the center of
                attraction and emerge themselves as potential citizens to contribute in the development of society. This
                museum will help us to participate or be active in society “. “The society which never equals us how we
                can fight with them being marginalized? Setting up the museum of our glorious historical musical
                traditions will be an answer. This museum will also remain the symbol of humiliation for our community“
                states president of Gandarva uplift society.
                <br><br>
                What’s the common understanding of museums for people who barely can read or write – museum in
                cities have different intellectual discourses but in this tiny village the case is different. Raised in
                predicament how the idea of museums arosed in minstrels mind and what motivates them?

                Our goal is to promote cultural dignity in our society through our art, and we believe that this film

                help us to advocate. Gandarva Community is underprivileged and deprived of dignity. Using our art as a
                medium of reflection of our society and culture we made documentary as a clear mirror and gave it
                back to communities. We hope people can overlook the loop holes inside society and generate
                necessary support policy from local stakeholders and administration.

                We intended to use documentary film as a medium to bring critical discourses in the society in the
                presence Local stakeholders and communities. We believe everything in society is intermingled, and
                change happens through implementation of policy. Regardless, we can penetrate individual conscience
                to see the distinction between fair and unfair. We wanted to document overshadowed stories and
                situations of Gandarvas to help them retain their dignity in existing society. Through this documentary
                we could tell the local community about their history, culture and impact of their music before. We
                believe this educational process of sharing and cultural exchange with community people gave them a
                sense of worth and motivated them to keep the culture alive - as we intend – saugat upreti | film maker

                musical culture and inspire local youth to appreciate the depth of their musical history/ tradition. At
                the
                present time life stories of individual musicians, like Shiva Gandharva and Narbahadur Gaine,
                illuminates
                how even the most skillful music-making has not provided the needed social status and economic
                security but rather demotivates the coming generation to pick up the musical instruments passed from
                forefathers rather look for daily wage work.
